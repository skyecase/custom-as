**[Scene: Close-up of Newton MessagePad, stylus in action, screen animations]**  
**Narrator**: The Newton wasn’t just a concept—it was a technological marvel. Let’s explore the features that made it groundbreaking and the flaws that held it back.  

**[Visual: Table graphic showing Newton models and specs]**  
**Narrator**: From 1993 to 1998, the Newton evolved through several models. The MessagePad 100, launched August 3, 1993, for $700, featured a 20 MHz ARM 610 processor, 640KB SRAM, and a 336x240 monochrome LCD. It introduced stylus input, infrared “beaming,” and apps like Notes, Names, and Dates. Its CalliGrapher handwriting recognition, however, was notoriously inaccurate.  

**[Scene: MessagePad 110 and 120, new form factor]**  
**Narrator**: The 1994 MessagePad 110 offered a smaller design and longer battery life with OS 1.3. The MessagePad 120 and 130 added dual handwriting recognition—CalliGrapher and Rosetta, a print-only recognizer needing no training. Features like “Ink Text,” screen rotation, and optional keyboards showed versatility.  

**[Visual: MessagePad 2000, sleek design, backlit screen]**  
**Narrator**: The 1997 MessagePad 2000 was a leap forward with a 162 MHz StrongARM 110 processor, 5MB RAM, and a 480x320 grayscale backlit display. It included dual PCMCIA slots, an InterConnect port, and Newton OS 2.1’s improved Rosetta engine. The MessagePad 2100, with 8MB RAM, was the final, most powerful model.  

**[Interview Clip: Newton enthusiast]**  
**Enthusiast**: “The MessagePad 2000 felt like a modern device. It had apps, connectivity—everything we now expect from smartphones.”  

**[Visual: Table of Newton limitations]**  
**Narrator**: But high prices ($700–$950), early handwriting issues, slow CPUs, limited memory, and a complex UI hindered adoption. Competitors like the PalmPilot, with simpler designs, dominated the market.  

**[Scene: Harry McCracken using Newton]**  
**Narrator**: Harry McCracken, who bought a MessagePad for $700, used it for articles and games like *Klondike* but noted, “It was too big, too expensive, and too ambitious for its time.”

## Act 8 : Return Of A Visionary 
Visuals: Archival footage of Steve Jobs at an Apple event, intercut with iconic Apple products (Macintosh, iPod, iPhone). Upbeat, inspirational music plays.
Narrator:In the world of technology, one name stands above the rest: Steve Jobs. A visionary who didn’t just innovate—he bent the status quo. Through relentless focus, minimalism, and an unyielding drive for excellence, Jobs transformed Apple from the brink of collapse to a trillion-dollar titan. But how did he do it? And why did he make the tough call to kill the Apple Newton, a pioneering device? This is the story of how Steve Jobs worked, thought, and reshaped the future.
### Act 8.1 The Crisis and the Return (2 minutes)
Visuals: Clips of Apple’s chaotic product lineup in the 1990s, headlines about Apple’s financial losses, and Jobs returning to Apple in 1997.
Narrator:In 1997, Apple was in freefall. The company was losing over a billion dollars annually, its market share had plummeted to just 4%, and it was a mere 90 days from bankruptcy. The product line was a mess—over a dozen Macintosh models, printers, peripherals, and a confusing array of devices like the Apple Newton. Even Apple’s own executives struggled to recommend a product to customers.
Visuals: Footage of Jobs in a product meeting, reenactment of him shouting “Stop! This is crazy!” and drawing a 2x2 matrix on a whiteboard.
Narrator:When Steve Jobs returned as interim CEO, he saw chaos and acted decisively. In a now-legendary moment, he halted a product meeting, exclaiming, “Stop! This is crazy!” He grabbed a marker and drew a simple 2x2 grid: Consumer and Pro on one axis, Desktop and Portable on the other. His vision? Just four best-in-class products. This was Jobs’ philosophy of Simplicity Through Focus—cut the clutter, prioritize what matters, and execute with precision.
Quote (Walter Isaacson, from biography):“Deciding what not to do is as important as deciding what to do. That’s true for companies, and it’s true for products.”
### Act 8.2: The Power of Minimalism (2 minutes)
Visuals: Images of Jobs’ minimalist home, the sleek iMac, and the “Think Different” campaign launch.
Narrator:Jobs’ approach was rooted in minimalism. He believed that simplicity wasn’t just about aesthetics—it was about clarity of thought. His home, famously sparse with a single Tiffany lamp, reflected this ethos. In business, he applied the same principle, slashing 70% of Apple’s product line, including printers, scanners, and the Newton PDA. He streamlined manufacturing, cut inventory by over 80%, and focused Apple’s engineering talent on fewer, high-quality projects.
Visuals: Clips of the “Think Different” ad, featuring icons like Einstein and Gandhi.
Narrator:Jobs launched the “Think Different” campaign in 1997, not to sell a product, but to redefine Apple’s identity. It celebrated those who challenged convention—much like Jobs himself. He wasn’t afraid to say “no” to good ideas if they didn’t align with his vision. As Jony Ive, Apple’s design chief, recalled, “Innovation is saying no to a thousand things.”
Quote (Jony Ive):“The hardest thing is when you think you have this great idea, and you start to get attached to it. But the really great people are the ones who can prune away all the unnecessary stuff and focus on what’s truly important.”
## Act 8.3: The Newton’s Demise (3 minutes)
Visuals: Archival images of the Newton MessagePad, its handwriting recognition demo, and Doonesbury cartoons mocking its flaws.
Narrator:The Apple Newton, launched in 1993, was a bold attempt at a new category: the Personal Digital Assistant. It promised handwriting recognition, email, and a futuristic “intelligent assistant.” But despite its pioneering spirit, the Newton struggled. Its $700 price tag was prohibitive, its handwriting recognition was famously unreliable—mocked in Doonesbury comics and The Simpsons—and it sold only 200,000 units in five years, far below Apple’s expectations.
Visuals: Footage of the Palm Pilot, contrasted with the bulkier Newton.
Narrator:By 1997, competitors like the Palm Pilot had outmaneuvered the Newton. The Palm Pilot was cheaper, simpler, and more reliable, with a pocketable design and intuitive Graffiti handwriting system. It captured 66% of the PDA market, while the Newton limped along with just 6%. Jobs saw the writing on the wall: the Newton didn’t fit his vision of simplicity or Apple’s core strengths in intuitive personal computing.
Visuals: Reenactment of Jobs waving his fingers, saying, “God gave us ten styluses.”
Narrator:Jobs famously disliked the Newton’s stylus, quipping, “God gave us ten styluses—let’s not invent another.” But his decision to kill the Newton wasn’t just about styluses or personal grudges against John Sculley’s pet project. It was strategic. Jobs believed the Newton was mismanaged, its technology promising but flawed, and its market too niche. By shutting it down, he freed up engineers to focus on new mobile devices—ideas that would later blossom into the iPhone and iPad.
Quote (Steve Jobs, to Walter Isaacson):“If Apple had been in a less precarious situation, I would have drilled down myself to figure out how to make it work. I didn’t trust the people running it. My gut was that there was some really good technology, but it was fucked up by mismanagement.”
### Act 8.4: Bending the Status Quo (2 minutes)
Visuals: Clips of the iMac launch, iPod reveal, and iPhone keynote.
Narrator:Jobs’ ruthless focus paid off. In 1998, Apple launched the iMac, a sleek, colorful desktop that captured the consumer imagination. In 2001, the iPod revolutionized music. And in 2007, the iPhone redefined mobile computing. Each product embodied Jobs’ philosophy: simplicity, excellence, and a relentless push to challenge the status quo. The Newton’s DNA—its ARM processor, intelligent assistant concepts, and mobile computing vision—lived on in these successors.
Visuals: Graph showing Apple’s market cap soaring from $2 billion in 1997 to $1 trillion in 2018.
Narrator:Within a year of Jobs’ return, Apple turned a $309 million profit, erasing a $1.04 billion loss. By 2018, Apple became the first U.S. company to reach a trillion-dollar valuation. Jobs’ ability to say “no,” to focus on what truly mattered, and to bend the status quo through minimalist design and strategic vision transformed Apple into a global powerhouse.


## Act 9: The Newton’s Demise (1997–1998) (5 minutes)
**[Scene: Clip from *Steve Jobs* (2015), Jobs confronting Sculley]**  
**Narrator**: On February 27, 1998, Jobs discontinued the Newton, citing its 6% market share and high costs. The 2015 film *Steve Jobs* suggests revenge against Sculley’s legacy played a role, but Jobs’ aversion to styluses and focus on intuitive interfaces were key.  

**[Visual: Newton fans protesting at Macworld]**  
**Narrator**: Fans protested, but Jobs stood firm. McCracken wrote, “It felt like a betrayal, but Jobs saw it as a necessary step to save Apple.”  

**[Interview Clip: Former Apple executive]**  
**Executive**: “Jobs hated the Newton’s complexity. He wanted Apple to focus on products that could redefine markets, not niche devices.”  

**[Scene: Jobs at Macworld 1997, announcing “Think Different”]**  
**Narrator**: The “Think Different” campaign, launched in 1997, redefined Apple’s identity, paving the way for a new era of innovation.

## Act 10: The Newton’s Legacy and the Rise of ARM (10 minutes)

**\[Scene: iMac G3 unveiling, vibrant colors, cheering crowds]**
**Narrator**: With the Newton gone, Apple launched the iMac G3 in August 1998, selling 800,000 units in five months and turning a \$309 million profit. McCracken noted, “The Newton’s failure taught Apple to prioritize simplicity.”

**\[Visual: Engineers working on iMac, Jobs inspecting prototypes]**
**Narrator**: But the Newton’s true legacy wasn’t the iPhone or iPad—it was the creation of the ARM chip, and the role Apple played in the transformation of a struggling British company, Acorn Computers.

### **The Relationship Between Newton, Apple, Acorn Computers, and the ARM Chip**

Acorn Computers, a British company, was a significant player in the 1980s personal computer market, known for the BBC Micro. By the mid-1980s, it faced challenges with the 6502 processor, prompting it to develop a new chip. Under the leadership of Roger Wilson (now Sophie Wilson), Acorn created the Acorn RISC Machine (ARM), a Reduced Instruction Set Computing processor. The ARM1, completed in 1985, delivered strong performance with low power consumption—perfect for future compact devices.

However, Acorn lacked the financial power to push the chip into global markets. Enter Apple.

### **How Newton Led to the Creation of ARM Ltd.**

Apple’s Newton project, initiated in 1987, was a vision to build a Personal Digital Assistant with handwriting recognition and mobility. It required a highly efficient processor, but the initial choice, AT\&T’s Hobbit chip, failed to deliver.

By 1990, Newton engineers sought alternatives. Acorn’s ARM chip caught Apple’s attention. On September 8, 1990, Apple acquired 43% of a new chip company spun off from Acorn—Advanced RISC Machines (ARM)—with Olivetti and VLSI joining the venture. Apple’s \$2.5 million investment gave ARM the capital and credibility to grow.

### **Newton’s Role in ARM’s Growth**

The Newton MessagePad, launched in 1993, used the ARM 610—a 20 MHz chip that powered handwriting recognition and a 240x336 screen, all on just four AAA batteries. Though the Newton failed commercially, its use of the ARM chip proved the viability of RISC architecture in mobile computing.

Newton became ARM’s first major real-world application. Apple’s technical collaboration, financial support, and demand for low-power performance pushed ARM’s design philosophy: high efficiency, low energy, and scalability. Larry Tesler, Apple’s Newton lead, even sat on ARM’s board.

**\[Visual: Apple engineers collaborating with ARM]**
**Narrator**: Without Newton, ARM might have stayed a niche UK chip project. Instead, it became a global standard.

### **ARM Today: From Newton to the World’s Smartphones**

The Newton helped launch ARM, and ARM changed the world.

* ARM processors now power over **90% of smartphones**, including every iPhone and iPad.
* Apple’s A-series and M-series chips are based on the ARM architecture.
* ARM’s licensing model—developed during the Newton era—enabled wide adoption in phones, tablets, wearables, and more.
* The company went public in 1998, and was acquired by SoftBank in 2016. In 2023, ARM filed for another IPO, valued at over **\$60 billion**.

**\[Interview Clip: ARM Engineer]**
**Engineer**: “The Newton gave us our first major product test. Apple’s challenge helped refine ARM for a future we couldn’t imagine yet.”

**\[Visual: Timeline from Newton → ARM 610 → Global chip adoption]**
**Narrator**: Newton didn’t lead directly to the iPhone—but it did lead to ARM. And ARM led to everything.
